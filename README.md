# AutoLoc
Placeholder for the code of our ECCV'18 paper. Code will be released probably by the end of this year. Thanks.

For experiments on AN v1.2, note that please refer to https://github.com/wanglimin/UntrimmedNet/issues/16 to find UntrimmedNet pre-trained model on train set. Models released here http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/untrimmednet_model/ were trained on train+val set.
